# Azure云中的机器学习简介
## 什么是机器学习?
机器学习是一项帮助计算机从现有数据中学习，从未预测未来的行为、结果和趋势的数据科学技术。
Machine learning is a technique of data science that helps computers learn from existing data in order to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends.  

这些基于机器学习的预测能够帮助应用和设备更加智能。当你在网上购物时。机器学习能够基于你的购买记录推荐其他你可能会喜欢的商品。当你通过信用卡支付时，机器学习通过对比过去消费记录来帮助判断是否存在盗刷现象。当你的扫地机器人为你打扫房间时，机器学习可以帮助它判断是否已经打扫干净。
These forecasts or predictions from machine learning can make apps and devices smarter. When you shop online, machine learning helps recommend other products you might like based on what you've purchased. When your credit card is swiped, machine learning compares the transaction to a database of transactions and helps detect fraud. When your robot vacuum cleaner vacuums a room, machine learning helps it decide whether the job is done.

通过几个简单的视频[数据科学入门](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/machine-learning/machine-learning-data-science-for-beginners-the-5-questions-data-science-answers.md)，来简单的了解一下。
无需任何术语与数学基础，数据科学入门将通过一个简单的预测模型为你讲述机器学习的概念。
For a brief overview, try the video series [Data Science for Beginners](machine-learning-data-science-for-beginners-the-5-questions-data-science-answers.md). Without using jargon or math, Data Science for Beginners introduces machine learning and steps you through a simple predictive model.

Azure Machine Learning has everything you need to create complete predictive analytics solutions in the cloud, from a large algorithm library, to a studio for building models, to an easy way to deploy your model as a web service. Quickly create, test, operationalize, and manage predictive models.

### Machine Learning Studio: Create predictive models
In [Machine Learning Studio](machine-learning-what-is-ml-studio.md), you can quickly create predictive models by dragging, dropping, and connecting modules. You can experiment with different combinations, and [try it out for free](https://studio.azureml.net/?selectAccess=true&o=2).
* In [Cortana Intelligence Gallery](machine-learning-gallery-how-to-use-contribute-publish.md), you can try analytics solutions authored by others or contribute your own. Post questions or comments about experiments to the community, or share links to experiments via social networks such as LinkedIn and Twitter.

  ![Try predictive experiments or contribute your own in Azure Cortana Intelligence Gallery](./media/machine-learning-what-is-machine-learning/machine-learning-cortana-intelligence-gallery.png)
* Use a large library of [Machine Learning algorithms and modules](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/f5c746fd-dcea-4929-ba50-2a79c4c067d7) in Machine Learning Studio to jump-start your predictive models. Choose from sample experiments, R and Python packages, and best-in-class algorithms from Microsoft businesses like Xbox and Bing. Extend Studio modules with your own custom [R](machine-learning-r-quickstart.md) and [Python](machine-learning-execute-python-scripts.md) scripts.

### Operationalize predictive analytics solutions by publishing your own
The following tutorials show you how to operationalize your predictive analytics models:

 * [Deploy web services](machine-learning-publish-a-machine-learning-web-service.md)
 * [Retrain models through APIs](machine-learning-retrain-models-programmatically.md)
 * [Manage web service endpoints](machine-learning-create-endpoint.md)
 * [Scale a web service](machine-learning-scaling-webservice.md)
 * [Consume web services](machine-learning-consume-web-services.md)

 ## 机器学习的关键术语和概念
 机器学习的术语可能令人困惑。以下随时关键术语的定义。
Machine learning terms can be confusing. Here are definitions of key terms to help you. Use comments following to tell us about any other term you'd like defined.

### 数据探索, 描述性分析, 和 预测分析

**数据探索**是收集大型且通常为非结构化的数据集信息的过程，以便找到用于集中分析的特征。
**Data exploration** is the process of gathering information about a large and often unstructured data set in order to find characteristics for focused analysis.
**数据挖掘**是指自动化数据探索。
**Data mining** refers to automated data exploration.
**描述性分析**是分析数据集以便总结发生了什么的过程。绝大多数商业分析-如销售报告，网络指标和社交网络分析-都是描述性的。
**Descriptive analytics** is the process of analyzing a data set in order to summarize what happened. The vast majority of business analytics - such as sales reports, web metrics, and social networks analysis - are descriptive.
**预测分析**是从历史或当前数据建立模型以便预测未来结果的过程。
**Predictive analytics** is the process of building models from historical or current data in order to forecast future outcomes.

### 监督和非监督学习
 **Supervised learning** algorithms are trained with labeled data - in other words, data comprised of examples of the answers wanted. For instance, a model that identifies fraudulent credit card use would be trained from a data set with labeled data points of known fraudulent and valid charges. Most machine learning is supervised.

 **Unsupervised learning** is used on data with no labels, and the goal is to find relationships in the data. For instance, you might want to find groupings of customer demographics with similar buying habits.

### 模型训练和评级
A machine learning model is an abstraction of the question you are trying to answer or the outcome you want to predict. Models are trained and evaluated from existing data.

#### 训练数据
When you train a model from data, you use a known data set and make adjustments to the model based on the data characteristics to get the most accurate answer. In Azure Machine Learning, a model is built from an algorithm module that processes training data and functional modules, such as a scoring module.

In supervised learning, if you're training a fraud detection model, you use a set of transactions that are labeled as either fraudulent or valid. You split your data set randomly, and use part to train the model and part to test or evaluate the model.

#### 评价数据
Once you have a trained model, evaluate the model using the remaining test data. You use data you already know the outcomes for, so that you can tell whether your model predicts accurately.

## 其他常见的机器学习术语
* **algorithm**: A self-contained set of rules used to solve problems through data processing, math, or automated reasoning.
* **anomaly detection**: A model that flags unusual events or values and helps you discover problems. For example, credit card fraud detection looks for unusual purchases.
* **categorical data**: Data that is organized by categories and that can be divided into groups. For example a categorical data set for autos could specify year, make, model, and price.
* **classification**: A model for organizing data points into categories based on a data set for which category groupings are already known.
* **feature engineering**: The process of extracting or selecting features related to a data set in order to enhance the data set and improve outcomes. For instance, airfare data could be enhanced by days of the week and holidays. See [Feature selection and engineering in Azure Machine Learning](machine-learning-feature-selection-and-engineering.md).
* **module**: A functional part in a Machine Learning Studio model, such as the Enter Data module that enables entering and editing small data sets. An algorithm is also a type of module in Machine Learning Studio.
* **model**: A supervised learning model is the product of a machine learning experiment comprised of training data, an algorithm module, and functional modules, such as a Score Model module.
* **numerical data**: Data that has meaning as measurements (continuous data) or counts (discrete data). Also referred to as *quantitative data*.
* **partition**: The method by which you divide data into samples. See [Partition and Sample](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn905960.aspx) for more information.
* **prediction**: A prediction is a forecast of a value or values from a machine learning model. You might also see the term "predicted score." However, predicted scores are not the final output of a model. An evaluation of the model follows the score.
* **regression**: A model for predicting a value based on independent variables, such as predicting the price of a car based on its year and make.
* **score**: A predicted value generated from a trained classification or regression model, using the [Score Model module](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn905995.aspx) in Machine Learning Studio. Classification models also return a score for the probability of the predicted value. Once you've generated scores from a model, you can evaluate the model's accuracy using the [Evaluate Model module](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn905915.aspx).
* **sample**: A part of a data set intended to be representative of the whole. Samples can be selected randomly or based on specific features of the data set.
